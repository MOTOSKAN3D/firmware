ChangeLog
=========

2014-9-1:  Removed support for 8051 from main source tree.

  REASON: There are three:
  1. The older 8051 architecture has a hardware stack and required special
     case handling throughout the OS.  With a current focus on supporting
     true processes, the limitations of the 8051 architecture are becoming
     obstacles to the advancement of the design.
  2. The port was at one time functional, but never worked reliably.  It
     would occasionally exceed the limited 8051 stack size.  It is possible,
     however, that this problem could be fixed with additional tuning.
  3. The 8051 is basically a bad architecture for multi-tasking.  Since
     the 8051 has a hardware stack, the entire stack has to be copied on
     contex switches.
  4. I do not thing that anyone has ever used the port and because of bit
     rot, it is not even certain that it is still function.

2014-9-5:  Removed support for the 16z board from the main source tree.

  REASON:
    The port is not yet ready for use.  It may return to the NuttX source
    tree at some point in the future.
